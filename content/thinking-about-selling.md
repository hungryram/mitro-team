### Considering selling your home? The Las Vegas Real Estate Market is HOT! Sellers are receiving multiple offers with minimal days on the market when priced right, but that is all about to change. 

### All real estate markets are cyclical. Don't miss the top of this cycle. Cash Out before prices begin to shift. Current prices are well beyond  the affordability levels for most Las Vegas residents. When the FED decides to raise interest rates affordability will only get worse. As more homes hit the market prices will start to level out and eventually retreat to lower levels.

### When setting your list price don't make the common seller mistake of over listing your home.

#### In setting the list price for your home, you should be aware of buyer’s frame of mind. Based on a list of houses for sale in your neighborhood (which can be in the form of a printed list from us, or online search results that you’ve found yourself), buyers will determine which houses they want to view. 

#### Consider the following pricing factors:

#### -By setting the price too high, your house won’t be picked for viewing, even though it may be much nicer than others in the area.

#### -If your priced too low, you could be short-changing yourself. Sure, your house will sell fast, but before it has had time to find a buyer who would have paid more.

#### -Never say "asking" price, which implies you don't expect to get it.

#### -Talk to Las Vegas' top experienced real estate experts. Call Jacob and Beth 702-285-3444

##### Using Comparable Sales  
No matter how attractive and polished your house, buyers will be comparing its price with everything else on the market. Your best guide is a record of what the buying public has been willing to pay in the past few months for property in your neighborhood like yours. We furnish data on sale figures for those "comps", and analyze them for a suggested listing price. The decision about how much to ask, though, is always yours. The list of comparable sales we bring to you, along with data about other houses in your neighborhood presently on the market, is used for a  Comparative Market Analysis (CMA).

#### You need a Team of Experienced Agents

##### While most agents can only help you buy or sell your home because they only have a sales license. The Mitro Team has 3 licenses: Sales, Property Management and Broker Sales. We can help you find a property, and we can help you get your home rented and even manage it for you.  And if you've considered going solar we can also connect you with Top Tier Solar panels and a system that will save you money while helping the environment.
