Thinking about Remodeling, but don't know if your going to get value back on your design ideas? Well, there are a ton of ways to make changes to your home and see a return on your investment. Here are some links to new, modern remodel ideas.

**Not every remodeling plan will give you money back**

when it's time to sell your home.

Think before you throw a bunch of money into a project. Will my choices for materials and colors be liked by the greater public? Am I going to have to repaint when it's time to sell?

When considering a remodel keep these suggestions in the back of your mind.

* The Big Returns are on Bathrooms and Kitchens. The two rooms that benefit most from even small renovations are the kitchen and bathroom. Replace outdated vanities, plumbing and lighting fixtures in the bathrooms.
* A Coat of Paint goes a long way and can be done by most homeowners.
* Energy Improvements. An energy-efficient home will save you money now, which can be applied to other updates, and is a more valuable and marketable asset in the long run.
* Low- Maintenance Landscaping. Plant shrubs and colorful plants that add curb appeal, but require less water and trimming.
* Flooring. Don't forget to update the biggest part of your home, the ground you walk on. Replacing old dingy carpet with some modern tile or wood will definitely improve your entire homes appearance. When doing the floors adding 5" baseboards should be on the list.
