Jacob Mitro is originally from Dallas, Texas. He arrived in the Las Vegas Valley late in the summer of 1999 with his wife to be, Beth Mitro, who is also a Realtor and our Team Leader at LIFE Realty District.

​

Starting their Vegas Life from scratch, literally, when they started out here everything they owned fit into a Mitsubishi Eclipse hatchback. They had a blow up air mattress, their clothes, and each other and that's all. Plenty to get started on a new life. Jacob started working at Las Vegas Color Graphics in 1999. In 2001 Jacob went to Real Estate school and by January 16th, 2002 he was officially a Licensed agent. In the time they've lived here they have expanded their family with 2 terrific, well behaved boys. He has coached his kids baseball and flag football teams, volunteered on his boys Swim team.

​

When Jacob was in High School he lived in Kansas City, Missouri. He was on the State Champions Park Hill Swimming & Diving Team as both a diver and sprint swimmer. He moved back to Dallas in 1992 and he graduated with high honors from Woodrow Wilson High School in East Dallas in 1993 .

He has been a member of the Lodge of Freemasons at Nellis Lodge #46 F&AM since 2011 and actively supports the lodge and their charities and is happy to answer any questions about the Fraternity.

​

Jacob loves the outdoors and regularly goes out to the Nevada, Utah, and Arizona deserts to hike, camp, bike, meteorite hunt, target practice, and explore what these wonderful, natural areas have to offer. Always keeping in mind to leave the land how you find it. "Pack it in, Pack it out". He knows many of the local hiking trails and where to get away from the hectic urban lifestyle in Las Vegas. He also is a PADI certified diver and has explored both, the Great Barrier Reef, and the worlds 2nd largest reef off the coast of Belize. He enjoys adventuring to remote and exotic places around the world with his family, away from civilization, during his off time. He believes it is important to take time away with family to learn about new cultures. He is also an avid ancient history and civilization student. He and has been to half a dozen or so ancient sites including: [Xunantunich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd4XUZj7l6I), [Caracol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPrzp4n7Hho), [Chichen Itza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYRqHqHmb74), and [Tulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJfBk0Zq4g). Going to [Machu Picchu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9J5xnTVMA), [Puma Punku](https://hiddenincatours.com/), Petra, the Great Pyramid, and [Angkor Wat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat) are all on his Bucket List.

​

He has been selling real estate since January 2002 and managing his client's property portfolios since August 2008. He holds a Real Estate Sales License and a separate Property Management Permit, so he is truly a FULL SERVICE real estate agent with abilities other agents don't possess. During the REO boom he was the exclusive listing agent for all of Vanderbilt Mortgage's REO portfolio in the state of Nevada. He specializes in Henderson and Green Valley, Summerlin, and the SW Las Vegas Valley areas. He works with first time home buyers, Sellers, Flippers, and Long Term Investors.

​

He has consistently been a Multi Million Dollar Producing agent every year and is experienced in contract negotiation, marketing, and getting deals closed. He has personally more than $50 million in Real Estate sales at an average of $244,000 per transaction under his belt. His clients demand his attention to the local market data and analysis, and he has a proven track record in completing more than 5000 accurate, QC passed Broker Price Opinions that are required in getting all short sales approved.

​

Don't go with an agent that tells you your home is worth more than it actually is just to get you to sign their listing agreement, because you'll end up with a home that will stay on the market with multiple price reductions and potentially no sale. The right way to list a home is to price the home correctly from the very beginning and to list with us. We have a proven track record and our list price to sales price ratio is 98.86%.

​

In 2019 Jacob got his Nevada Photovoltaic Installers License. He's been an advocate and student of the solar industry since 2008. He decided to put his mind where his mouth was and get licensed. If you have any questions about the benefits of solar power give him a call.
